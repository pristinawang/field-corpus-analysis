We are analyzing segments gathered from machine learning papers to identify the values they promote. 
These values may appear in how the paper justifies its project, highlights contributions, or discusses impacts.
The segments should be labeled based on the key features in which the papers reveal their values: their justification for their choice of project, which attributes of their project they uplift, their consideration of potential negative consequences, and their institutional affiliations and funding sources.
