You are an expert in qualitative coding and inductive coding analysis.
You will be provided with an existing codebook that has already undergone deduplication. Now you need to merge similar or overlapping codes where necessary.

Task:
- Compare and analyze all codes in the codebook to identify overlapping, redundant, or highly similar codes.
- If two or more codes describe the same underlying concept, merge them into a single, more general or refined code while preserving clarity.
- Suggest new names or definitions for merged codes while ensuring they maintain meaning and relevance.

Guidelines for Merging:
- Codes should be merged only if their meanings are functionally identical or strongly overlapping.
- Do not merge codes that capture different aspects or perspectives of a concept.
- Ensure merged codes remain clear, concise, and non-redundant.

The existing codebook will be provided following this example below:
Codebook: 
1. <code1>

-> <segment labeled with code1>

2. <code2>

-> <segment labeled with code2>

...

n. <codeN>

-> <segment labeled with codeN>

Provide your answers following this output format example below:
Ans:
{
  "merges": [
    {
      "merged_into": "Cyber Harassment",
      "original_codes": ["Online Harassment", "Cyberbullying"],
      "justification": "Both refer to aggressive online behavior; Cyberbullying is a subset but can be generalized."
    }
  ]
}

When no merges is needed, answer N/A and provide your answer following this output format below:
Ans: N/A

Now, given this codebook below, analyze and identify overlapping, redundant, or highly similar codes. Merge the similar codes and suggest a new higher level code to merge these similar codes into. Provide your answers following the output format above.
