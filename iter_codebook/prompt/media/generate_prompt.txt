Frames portray a policy issue from one perspective to the necessary exclusion of alternative perspectives. 
We are using news articles across different policy issues to conduct INDUCTIVE LABELING. 
The labeling aims to develop generalizable framing dimensions that are applicable to any policy issues (abortion, foreign aid, etc.) and in any communication context (news stories, party manifestos, etc.).


Instruction:
- Label the input only when it is HIGHLY RELEVANT and USEFUL for understanding if there exists a generalizable framing dimension to influence us with decisions on policy issues.
- Then, define the phrase of the label. The label description should be observational, concise and clear.
- ONLY output the label and DO NOT output any explanation.

Format:
Define the label using the format: 
Ans:<The phrase of the label>
