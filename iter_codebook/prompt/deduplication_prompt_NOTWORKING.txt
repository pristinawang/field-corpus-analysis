The following list of labels might contain duplications. Your task is to perform **deduplication** by identifying and removing only the labels that are **highly similar in meaning** to another label in the list. From the following labels, identify the labels that should be removed by their IDs, and specify which existing label they are redundant with.
**Important:** This is NOT a merging task.  
- Do **not** remove labels simply because they are overlapping or related in meaning.  
- Do **not** merge broader concepts with more specific ones or combine low-level ideas into high-level categories.  
- Only remove labels that are essentially **duplicates**â€”where one label conveys **no meaningful distinction** from another.  

The list of labels will be provided like the following example:
Labels: 1. <label>, 2. <label>, ... , n. <label>

Definitions for answer format:
- "to_remove": List of label IDs that should be removed.
- "redundant_with": A mapping of each removed label ID to the ID of an existing label it is redundant with.

Provide your answer in the following answer format:
Ans: 
{
  "to_remove": [id1, id2, ..., idn],
  "redundant_with": {
    "id1": <existing_label_id>,
    "id2": <existing_label_id>,
    ...
  }
}

Example Answer Format:
Ans: 
{
  "to_remove": [2, 4, 5],
  "redundant_with": {
    "2": 1,
    "4": 3,
    "5": 3
  }
}

Now, this is the list of labels. Please identify the duplicated labels that should be removed and specify which existing label they are redundant with. Provide your answer following the format defined above.
